# Controller Mapping 
  
To Check DS4 Controls use the [GamePad](https://docs.yoyogames.com/source/dadiospice/002_reference/mouse,%20keyboard%20and%20other%20controls/gamepad%20input/index.html) commands    
Here is what each control maps to:  

gp_face1 = CROSS  
gp_face2 = SQUARE  
gp_face3 = CIRCLE  
gp_face4 = TRIANGLE  
  
gp_shoulderl = L1  
gp_shoulderr = R1  
gp_shoulderlb = L2  
gp_shoulderrb = R2  
  
gp_select = SELECT  
gp_start = START  
  
gp_stickl = L3  
gp_stickr = R3  
  
gp_padu = DPAD UP  
gp_padd = DPAD DOWN  
gp_padl = DPAD LEFT  
gp_padr = DPAD RIGHT  
  
gp_axislh = LEFT ANOLOUGE HORIZONTAL AXIES  
gp_axislv = LEFT ANOLOUGE VERTICAL AXIES  
  
gp_axisrh = RIGHT ANOLOUGE HORIZONTAL AXIES  
gp_axisrv = RIGHT ANOLOUGE VERTICAL AXIES
